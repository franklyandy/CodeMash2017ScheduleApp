# CodeMash 2017 Schedule App

This is a project that uses the CodeMash Schedule API in order to provide a
mobile experience using React Native.

To run the project, you will first need to make sure you have installed the
latest version of the React Native CLI. Next, cd to the src/CodeMashSchedule
directory.

To run on iOS, enter `react-native run-ios` at the terminal. If the react
packager is not running, it will be started for you. The iOS simulator will start
and you should see the application running.

To run on Android, you will first need to start the Android emulator. If you have
added the Android SDK tools to your path, you should be able to start the
emulator by running `android avd` in a new terminal window. This will allow you
to create a new virtual device or start an existing one. Start a device, and
then enter `react-native run-android` at the terminal. The application should
load on the emulator.
